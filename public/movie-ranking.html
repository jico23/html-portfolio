<h1>The Best Movies According To Jico</h1>
<br/>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Titanic</h3>

<p>This is my favorite movie. I only love the animation of it, but the historical aspect is all incorrect. The real name of the ship is the Olympic. The globalists or the Rothschild family intentionally sank the ship in order to kill thousands of people.</p>

<h3>SCAMDEMIC ERA</h3>

<P>This is not an official movie by any means, but this is certainly one of those blockbusters that I will pay to watch, especially if you are a truth teller like me.</P>

<h3>The Queen's Gambit</h3>

<p>It really made my sport of chess, "The biggest sport back in 2020." Now, millions of chess players are playing around the world. It really warms my heart that chess is now the most dominant sport again internationally like it was in the early 19th century.</p>
