<h1>About Me (Jico)</h1>
<p>
  I am a truth seeker who is studying about what is really happening in the world. I am also recently a YouTuber who got his own channel banned due to him disobeying the safety guidelines given by YouTube, but I mostly gave the facts on the Master’s agenda and why the fake Covid-19 vaccines is just a very small part of what his overall plan is in order to destroy the entire puppet-population.</p>

  I currently live in the Philippines where it’s main source of economy is the overseas’ slaves that my country sends to other parts of the world such as in Asia, Europe, and America. They live abroad just so they can be raped, tortured, burned, or any other kind of suffering that you can imagine. The salary grade is the same as what they make back here. The only major difference is that they don’t have any basic human rights abroad such as freedom of movement and freedom of speech because they have no choice other than total obedience to their paying master. The main problem of every average Filipino mind is that they have this illusion that going/living abroad will somehow make their lives better instead of just staying in their home country. The other main problem of the average Filipino is laziness. This principle does not only apply to Filipinos, but to every single person living in the world. True success can only be determined if you are willing to put in the necessary hours every single day so that you can fully  master your craft/work/job.</p>

  My main source of inspiration for writing the important contents/documents in my website are the people/patriarchs that I look up to in terms of telling the truth such as David Icke who I affectionately call grandpa David. He was the one who taught me that the only reason the “elites” have any power at all is because the puppet population gave it to them. Grandpa David said that the only reason the tiny few have been able to control the many throughout history is because the puppet population did not do anything to stop them. Knowing the truth is one thing, but saying/doing it is another. I would rather say/proclaim the little truth I know due to my limited knowledge rather than knowing the whole truth, but hiding/concealing it because I have a hidden agenda that I don’t want others to find out about. That is the ultimate purpose for starting my website is to tell the plain truth without being censored by other outside forces such as YouTube.</p>
